# LKSMart
 LKSN 2021 - Desktop Test Project
LKSMart is a proposed self-service desktop application to help customer in order and buy process. The application has four main key features such as: Manage Profile, Shopping, Transaction History and Point History. As a well-known C# developer, you are hired to develop this application. The analyst team already prepared the database design, and you can find it in LKSMart.sql file. You are not allowed to change the structure of the database. However, you may add additional records to the database. 

Analyst team also has two additional notes for you. First, all delete process is a soft-delete one. It means for delete process, instead of deleting the record, you only need to fill in deleted_at field. Second, every time a record is updated, make sure to record the time in last_updated_at field.

The designer also prepared the user interface design for you to use. Please try to stick into the given design. Some changes are allowed under the condition that you maintain all input output process. Some image files also given for you to be used in the application. 

Below, you will find detail of the application workflows and functions.
